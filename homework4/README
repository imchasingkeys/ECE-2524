Darren,


My format for storing the data was:
'PartID':'C86932','Description':'CAP|CHIP|TANT|4.7uF|16V|20%','Footprint':'1206','Quantity':'10'

Basically each value segment inside of quotes, pairs separated by commas, and each pair split by a ":". 

Here is the format for my commands: 

add 'PartID':'C86932','Description':'CAP|CHIP|TANT|4.7uF|16V|20%','Footprint':'1206','Quantity':'10'
(add followed by the record exactly as it would show up in the text)

remove C86932
(remove followed by just the part id number)

set Quantity:5 Footprint:1206
(set followed by the pair to be set followed by the pair to match, with values separated by colons)

list all
(lists all items)

list all sort Footprint
(list all followed by sort and then the attribute to sort by)

list all Footprint:1206
(list all followed by Attribute and value split by a colon)

For some reason a bunch of unneeded files uploaded with all of the other ones. These shouldn't interfere with running
the program. I couldn't figure out how to remove them. 

Also, in your example listed in the HW4 description you said that you would run each action on the record file,
and then run all the actions at once on the record file. 
But shouldn't you run "all_actions" on a copy of the record file? Because it will have changed from running the actions
individually right before. (i.e. you removed or added entries)
So that would be an invalid test right? 

I tested my program (using all_actions on a copy of the original records)
and I got that there was no difference.
