## Assignment Assignment    


When I started thinking about this assignment I thought about creating a complex directory that students
could use commands to get a desired output. Like searching for all the files in the directory that have a 
number in the name and contain a certain word, for example. But then I started thinking maybe it would be better 
to create an assignment that would demonstrate and push the collaboritive side of Unix/Linux - a project that would
make students work together on programs that would also work together.   

My idea for an assignment would be to design a set of programs, that starts with a certain input file and then ends with a desired output file. So
each student (or more likely they would work in groups so there are less programs) would be assigned a program whose specifications call for a specific
textual input and requre a specific textual output. One group would get the first program (which reads from the input file), a bunch of groups would get the middle 
programs, and then one group would get the final program which finishes and prints the final output file. Then, once the students finished their individual programs 
when they got to class you could join them by piping them together and see if the desired result is acquired!  

One way to increased the difficulty of the assignment, and possibly add more to the experience would be to only give them the first input file and the desired output file, and then just tell them what each program does along the way. This way, each team would have to confer with the team doing the program before their program, in order to make sure that there output matched the input they would use for their program. This would be even more collaborative. Groups would have to work together to make sure there programs were compatible along the way.  

This assignment would show the Unix design philosophy of working with text, the universal data type, and also demonstrate the power of simple programs that do things
well working together. It would be a great way to show how collaborative work can take a large task and split it into smaller more feasible ones.
